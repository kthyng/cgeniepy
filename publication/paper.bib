  abstract = {Mass extinction at the Cretaceous{\textendash}Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary coincides with the Chicxulub bolide impact and also falls within the broader time frame of Deccan trap emplacement. Critically, though, empirical evidence as to how either of these factors could have driven observed extinction patterns and carbon cycle perturbations is still lacking. Here, using boron isotopes in foraminifera, we document a geologically rapid surface-ocean pH drop following the Chicxulub impact, supporting impact-induced ocean acidification as a mechanism for ecological collapse in the marine realm. Subsequently, surface water pH rebounded sharply with the extinction of marine calcifiers and the associated imbalance in the global carbon cycle. Our reconstructed water-column pH gradients, combined with Earth system modeling, indicate that a partial {$\sim$}50\% reduction in global marine primary productivity is sufficient to explain observed marine carbon isotope patterns at the K-Pg, due to the underlying action of the solubility pump. While primary productivity recovered within a few tens of thousands of years, inefficiency in carbon export to the deep sea lasted much longer. This phased recovery scenario reconciles competing hypotheses previously put forward to explain the K-Pg carbon isotope records, and explains both spatially variable patterns of change in marine productivity across the event and a lack of extinction at the deep sea floor. In sum, we provide insights into the drivers of the last mass extinction, the recovery of marine carbon cycling in a postextinction world, and the way in which marine life imprints its isotopic signal onto the geological record.},

  abstract = {The early evolutionary and much of the extinction history of marine animals is thought to be driven by changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations ([O2]) in the ocean1{\textendash}3. In turn, [O2]~is widely assumed to be dominated by the geological history of atmospheric oxygen (pO2)4,5. Here, by contrast, we show by means of a series of Earth system model experiments how continental rearrangement during the Phanerozoic Eon~drives profound variations in ocean oxygenation and induces a fundamental decoupling in time between upper-ocean and benthic [O2]. We further identify the presence of state transitions in the global ocean circulation, which lead to extensive deep-ocean anoxia developing in the early Phanerozoic even under modern pO2. Our finding that ocean oxygenation oscillates over stable thousand-year (kyr) periods also provides a causal mechanism that might explain elevated rates of metazoan radiation and extinction during the early Palaeozoic~Era6. The absence, in our modelling, of any simple correlation between global climate and ocean ventilation, and the occurrence of profound variations in ocean oxygenation independent of atmospheric pO2, presents a challenge to the interpretation of marine redox proxies, but also points to a hitherto unrecognized role for continental configuration in the evolution of the biosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We have extended the 3-D ocean based "Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model" (GENIE-1) to help understand the role of ocean biogeochemistry and marine sediments in the long-term ({\textasciitilde}100 to 100 000 year) regulation of atmospheric CO2, and the importance of feedbacks between CO2 and climate. Here we describe the ocean carbon cycle, which in its first incarnation is based around a simple single nutrient (phosphate) control on biological productivity. The addition of calcium carbonate preservation in deep-sea sediments and its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 is presented elsewhere (Ridgwell and Hargreaves, 2007).  We have calibrated the model parameters controlling ocean carbon cycling in GENIE-1 by assimilating 3-D observational datasets of phosphate and alkalinity using an ensemble Kalman filter method. The calibrated (mean) model predicts a global export production of particulate organic carbon (POC) of 8.9 PgC yr-1, and reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen distributions in the ocean. For estimating biogenic calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production, we have devised a parameterization in which the CaCO3:POC export ratio is related directly to ambient saturation state. Calibrated global CaCO3 export production (1.2 PgC yr-1) is close to recent marine carbonate budget estimates.  The GENIE-1 Earth system model is capable of simulating a wide variety of dissolved and isotopic species of relevance to the study of modern global biogeochemical cycles as well as past global environmental changes recorded in paleoceanographic proxies. Importantly, even with 12 active biogeochemical tracers in the ocean and including the calculation of feedbacks between atmospheric CO2 and climate, we achieve better than 1000 years per (2.4 GHz) CPU hour on a desktop PC. The GENIE-1 model thus provides a viable alternative to box and zonally-averaged models for studying global biogeochemical cycling over all but the very longest ({$>$}1 000 000 year) time-scales.},

  abstract = {Planktic foraminifera are major marine calcifiers in the modern ocean, regulating the marine inorganic carbon pump, and generating marine fossil archives of past climate change. The foraminifera contain ecogroups with and without spines and algal symbionts, creating functional trait diversity which expands their ecological niches. Here, we incorporate symbiosis and spine traits into the symbiont-barren non-spinose foraminifer functional type in EcoGEnIE to represent all the extant foraminifera species. We calibrated the modelled new traits using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and identified the optimal model parameters from an ensemble of 1200 runs compared with global observations from core-top sediment samples, sediment traps, and plankton nets. The model successfully describes the global distribution and seasonal abundance variation of the four major foraminiferal functional groups. The model reproduces the dominance of the symbiont-obligate group in subtropical gyres and of the symbiont-barren types in the productive subpolar oceans. Global annual mean biomass and foraminifer-derived carbon export rate are correctly predicted compared to data, with biomass ranging from 0.001 to 0.010 mmol C m-3 and organic carbon export 0.002{\textendash}0.031 mmol C m-2 d-1. The model captures the seasonal peak time of biomass and organic carbon export but struggles to reproduce the amplitude of both in productive areas. The sparseness and uneven distribution of observations and the model's limitation in upwelling regions likely contribute to this discrepancy. Our model overcomes the lack of major groups in the previous ForamEcoGEnIE 1.0 version and offers the potential to explore foraminiferal ecology dynamics and its impact on biogeochemistry in modern, future, and paleogeographic environments.},

  abstract = {Climate changes have threatened marine organisms causing migrations, biomass reduction and extinctions. However, the capacity of marine species to adapt or acclimate to these changes remains poorly constrained in both geological and anthropogenic timescales. Such uncertainty makes modelling past and future ocean biodiversity and ecosystem functions challenging, particularly for the plankton community transferring energy to the whole ocean food web. Here, we use a global trait-based plankton model to estimate the thermal acclimation of planktic foraminifera (calcifying zooplankton) in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 ka), the pre-industrial (PI) era and future (2100) under 1 to 4{$^\circ$}C warming scenarios. The model shows that, during the slow deglacial transition (LGM to PI), the spinose (symbiont and non-symbiont) foraminifera ecogroups have acclimated while non-spinose (non-symbiont) foraminifera kept the same thermal preference. Our model result is supported by global fossil abundance datasets in the LGM and PI. Our study thus provides the first evidence that marine plankton can acclimate during the last deglacial warming, which we confirm by re-analyzing a longer-term global fossil observation (600 ka). However, with global warming continuing, our model predicts that the acclimation capacity of these ecogroups is saturating. Due to little acclimation to anthropogenic warming, foraminifera are forced to migrate poleward, dropping their global biomass by 2.5-12.2\% by 2100 relative to 2022 (depending on the warming scenarios). Despite paleo-evidence of foraminifera thermal acclimation, our study suggests that the current warming is pushing marine calcifiers outside their acclimation limits, which will worsen by 2100. This vulnerability might be stronger considering ocean acidification and symbiont bleaching effects.},

  abstract = {The PaleoceneâEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 56 Ma) is one of our best geological analogs for understanding climate dynamics in a âgreenhouseâ world. However, proxy data representing the event are only available from select marine and terrestrial sedimentary sequences that are unevenly distributed across Earthâs surface, limiting our view of the spatial patterns of climate change. Here, we use paleoclimate data assimilation (DA) to combine climate model and proxy information and create a spatially complete reconstruction of the PETM and the climate state that precedes it (âPETM-DAâ). Our data-constrained results support strong polar amplification, which in the absence of an extensive cryosphere, is related to temperature feedbacks and loss of seasonal snow on land. The response of the hydrological cycle to PETM warming consists of a narrowing of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, off-equatorial drying, and an intensification of seasonal monsoons and winter storm tracks. Many of these features are also seen in simulations of future climate change under increasing anthropogenic emissions. Since the PETM-DA yields a spatially complete estimate of surface air temperature, it yields a rigorous estimate of global mean temperature change (5.6 âC; 5.4 âC to 5.9 âC, 95\% CI) that can be used to calculate equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). We find that PETM ECS was 6.5 âC (5.7 âC to 7.4 âC, 95\% CI), which is much higher than the present-day range. This supports the view that climate sensitivity increases substantially when greenhouse gas concentrations are high.},

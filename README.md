`cgeniepy` is an Python interface to the output of [cGENIE Earth System Model](https://www.seao2.info/mymuffin.html). It is an alternative to the existing [MATLAB libraries](https://github.com/derpycode/muffinplot). It aims to facilitate the post-simulation analysis, including reading and analysing the model output, and observational data.

âš  `cgeniepy` is still in alpha phase and under active changes.

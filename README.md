`cgeniepy` is an Python package to analyse the output of [cGENIE Earth System Model](https://www.seao2.info/mymuffin.html). It aims to provide a set of convenient tools for the post-simulation analysis, including analysing the model output, plot publication-quality figures, and conducting model-data comparison.

âš  `cgeniepy` is still in alpha phase and under active changes.
